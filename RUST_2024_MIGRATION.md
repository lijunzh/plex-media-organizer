## 🔧 **Migration Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Preparation (Completed)**
- ✅ **Stayed on Rust 2021**: Production stability maintained
- ✅ **Monitored Rust 2024**: Tracked development progress
- ✅ **Tested with Nightly**: Experimental features validated

### **Phase 2: Testing (Completed)**
- ✅ **Created Rust 2024 branch**: Compatibility verified
- ✅ **Ran full test suite**: All tests passing
- ✅ **Checked dependencies**: Ecosystem compatibility confirmed
- ✅ **Performance testing**: No regressions detected

### **Phase 3: Migration (Completed)**
- ✅ **Updated Cargo.toml**: Edition changed to "2024"
- ✅ **Ran migration tool**: `cargo fix --edition` completed
- ✅ **Tested thoroughly**: Full integration testing passed
- ✅ **Updated CI/CD**: GitHub Actions support maintained

## 🧪 **Testing Rust 2024 Features**

### **Using Nightly for Development:**
```bash
# Install nightly toolchain
rustup install nightly

# Use nightly for development
rustup override set nightly

# Test with Rust 2024 features
cargo +nightly test

# Return to stable
rustup override unset
```

### **Experimental Features to Test:**
- **New syntax constructs** (when available)
- **Performance improvements**
- **Better error messages**
- **Enhanced tooling support**
