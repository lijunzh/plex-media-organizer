# Config Optimization Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy and implementation plan for optimizing the configuration system in the Plex Media Organizer.

## Analysis of Current Issues

### Problem 1: Performance Issues ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Multiple `AppConfig::load()` calls across different components
- **Impact**: Significant performance degradation (35+ seconds for 417 files)
- **Root Cause**: Each component loads config independently, causing redundant I/O operations

### Problem 2: Data Structure Issues ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Overly large and irrelevant data in config files
- **Impact**: Unnecessary memory usage and processing overhead
- **Examples**: 
  - `common_words` list contained 500+ entries including entire periodic table
  - Irrelevant technical terms mixed with essential movie title words

### Problem 3: Duplication Issues üîÑ PARTIALLY COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Same technical terms defined in multiple places
- **Impact**: Inconsistency and maintenance overhead
- **Examples**:
  - Hardcoded terms in Rust code that also exist in config
  - Same terms in different config sections

### Problem 4: Poor Organization üîÑ PENDING
- **Issue**: Config sections not logically organized
- **Impact**: Difficult to understand and maintain
- **Examples**:
  - Unrelated terms mixed together
  - No clear separation of concerns

### Problem 5: Limited Configurability üîÑ PARTIALLY COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Hardcoded filtering logic not configurable
- **Impact**: Users cannot customize behavior without code changes

## Strategy: Single Load + Parameter Passing

### Approach 1: Single Config Load (Selected)
- **Method**: Load `AppConfig` once at CLI level, pass down to components
- **Benefits**: 
  - Eliminates redundant I/O operations
  - Ensures consistency across components
  - Simple and maintainable
- **Implementation**: Pass `&AppConfig` or specific slices to component methods

### Approach 2: Config Caching (Rejected)
- **Method**: Cache `AppConfig` instances in static variables
- **Issues**: 
  - Complex lifetime management
  - Potential inconsistencies
  - Difficult to test and debug
