## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ ([Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/))
- Git

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/plex-media-organizer.git
cd plex-media-organizer

# Install dependencies
cargo build

# Set up configuration for testing
cargo run -- setup
```

## üîß Development Workflow

### 1. **Create a Feature Branch**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. **Make Your Changes**
- Follow Rust coding standards
- Add comprehensive tests
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. **Run Tests**
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name
```

### 4. **Code Quality Checks**
```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run clippy for linting
cargo clippy

# Check for security issues
cargo audit

# Quick quality check (run before committing)
cargo fmt && cargo clippy && cargo test
```

### 5. **Commit Your Changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature description

- Detailed description of changes
- Any breaking changes
- Related issue numbers"
```

### 6. **Push and Create PR**
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
# Create Pull Request on GitHub
```

## üìù Commit Message Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples
```
feat: add fuzzy search for better movie matching
fix: resolve TMDB API timeout issues
docs: update architecture for database integration
test: add comprehensive test suite for organizer
```

## üìö Documentation Requirements

### **Mandatory Documentation Updates**
For every feature PR, you **must** update:
- [ ] `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Add new features to "Recent Updates" section
- [ ] `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Update component status if needed
- [ ] `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Update "Next Steps" section
- [ ] `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Add performance metrics if applicable

### **Optional Documentation Updates**
- [ ] `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - For design changes
- [ ] `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - For plan updates
- [ ] `README.md` - For user-facing features
- [ ] `config_example.toml` - For new configuration options

**Remember**: Documentation is part of the feature, not a separate task!

## üîß Quality Assurance

### **Pre-PR Checklist**
- [ ] All tests pass (`cargo test`)
- [ ] Code formatting correct (`cargo fmt`)
- [ ] No clippy warnings (`cargo clippy`)
- [ ] Documentation updated (see above)
- [ ] Commit messages follow convention
- [ ] Feature branch is up to date with main

### **CI/CD Requirements**
- [ ] GitHub Actions pass
- [ ] Code coverage maintained
- [ ] Performance benchmarks pass
- [ ] Security checks pass

## üö´ What NOT to Do

- ‚ùå **Never push directly to main**
- ‚ùå **Never create separate PRs for documentation** (unless it's a pure docs PR)
- ‚ùå **Never merge features without documentation updates**
- ‚ùå **Never skip the PR review process**

### Examples
```
feat(parser): add support for new filename pattern
fix(tmdb): resolve API rate limiting issue
docs: update README with new usage examples
test: add comprehensive test coverage for movie parser
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: All new functions must have unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete workflows
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for >90% test coverage
- **Real Data**: Test with actual filename patterns

### Test Naming
```rust
#[test]
fn test_parse_chinese_english_bilingual() {
    // Test implementation
}

#[test]
fn test_parse_chinese_english_bilingual_with_special_characters() {
    // Test edge case
}
```

### Test Data
- Use realistic filename examples
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Test both success and failure scenarios

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Keep modules focused and single-purpose
- Use clear, descriptive names for functions and variables
- Follow Rust idioms and best practices

### Error Handling
- Use `anyhow::Result<T>` for error propagation
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Include context for debugging

### Performance
- Profile code for bottlenecks
- Use efficient data structures
- Minimize allocations in hot paths

## üìö Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Document all public functions and types
- Include usage examples
- Explain complex algorithms

### README Updates
- Update README.md for new features
- Include usage examples
- Update roadmap and status
