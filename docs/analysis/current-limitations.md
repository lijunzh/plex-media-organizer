### **File System Limitations**
- **Local Files Only**: Cannot organize cloud-stored or network files
- **Single Directory**: Processes one directory at a time
- **No Recursive Organization**: Cannot organize nested directory structures
- **File Permissions**: Requires appropriate file system permissions

### **Performance Constraints**
- **Sequential Processing**: Files processed one at a time (not fully parallel)
- **Memory Usage**: Large directories may consume significant memory
- **Database Size**: SQLite database grows with operation history
- **Cache Expiration**: TMDB cache expires after 24 hours

## üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Limitations**

### **Rollback Limitations**
- **Operation-Based**: Rollback only available for complete operations
- **No Partial Rollback**: Cannot rollback individual file changes
- **Database Dependency**: Rollback requires intact database
- **Time-Based**: Old operations may be cleaned up automatically

### **Error Recovery**
- **Stop on Error**: Processing stops on first critical error
- **No Automatic Retry**: Failed operations require manual intervention
- **Limited Error Context**: Some error messages may be generic
- **No Recovery Mode**: Cannot resume interrupted operations

## üìä **Accuracy Limitations**

### **Parsing Accuracy**
- **Filename Dependent**: Accuracy depends on filename quality
- **TMDB Coverage**: Limited to movies available in TMDB database
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Low-confidence matches may be skipped
- **No Learning**: System doesn't learn from user corrections

### **Title Matching**
- **Exact Match Preferred**: Fuzzy matching has limitations
- **Year Sensitivity**: Incorrect years may cause matching failures
- **Title Variations**: Some title variations may not be recognized
- **No Context Awareness**: Cannot use surrounding files for context

## üéØ **User Experience Limitations**

### **CLI Interface**
- **Command Line Only**: No graphical user interface
- **No Interactive Mode**: All operations require command-line input
- **Limited Progress**: Basic progress reporting only
- **No Real-Time Updates**: Cannot see changes as they happen

### **Configuration**
- **Manual Setup**: Requires manual API key configuration
- **Limited Customization**: Few configurable options
- **No Profiles**: Cannot save different configuration profiles
- **No Templates**: Cannot customize naming templates

## üìà **Scalability Limitations**

### **Large Libraries**
- **Memory Constraints**: Very large directories may cause memory issues
- **Processing Time**: Large libraries take significant time to process
- **Database Performance**: Large operation histories may slow queries
- **No Batching**: Cannot process multiple directories simultaneously

### **Concurrent Usage**
- **Single User**: Designed for single-user operation
- **No Multi-Processing**: Cannot run multiple instances simultaneously
- **File Locking**: May conflict with other file operations
- **No Distributed Processing**: Cannot distribute across multiple machines

## üîÆ **Future Limitations (Planned Features)**

### **Phase 2: TV Series Support**
- **Episode Detection**: Will add TV show episode pattern recognition
- **TVDB Integration**: Will add TVDB API for TV show metadata
- **Season Organization**: Will support season-based directory structures
- **Mixed Content**: Will handle movies and TV shows in same directory

### **Phase 3: Music Support**
- **Music Detection**: Will add music file format recognition
- **MusicBrainz Integration**: Will add MusicBrainz API for music metadata
- **Artist/Album Organization**: Will support music-specific directory structures
- **Track Naming**: Will apply music-specific naming conventions

### **Phase 4: Multi-Language & Multi-API**
- **Language Detection**: Will add automatic language detection
- **Multiple APIs**: Will support multiple external databases
- **Anime Support**: Will add specialized anime content handling
- **International Films**: Will enhance non-English movie support

## üéØ **Workarounds and Solutions**

### **For Current Limitations**

#### **Large Libraries**
- Process directories in smaller batches
- Use cleanup command to manage database size
- Monitor memory usage during processing

#### **API Rate Limits**
- Use caching to minimize API calls
- Process during off-peak hours
- Consider TMDB paid tier for higher limits

#### **Accuracy Issues**
- Review and manually correct low-confidence matches
- Use test command to preview results before organizing
- Provide feedback for future improvements

#### **File System Issues**
- Ensure proper file permissions
- Use dry-run mode to preview changes
- Keep backups before organizing

### **For Future Features**
- **TV Shows**: Use dedicated TV show organization tools until Phase 2
- **Music**: Use music-specific organization tools until Phase 3
- **International Content**: Use language-specific tools until Phase 4
- **Large Scale**: Consider dedicated media management solutions

## üìù **Documentation of Limitations**

### **Why Document Limitations?**
- **Set Expectations**: Help users understand what the tool can and cannot do
- **Guide Development**: Prioritize features based on user needs
- **Prevent Misuse**: Avoid users attempting unsupported operations
- **Plan Workarounds**: Help users find alternative solutions

### **Limitation Categories**
1. **Current Limitations**: What the tool cannot do now
2. **Technical Limitations**: Constraints due to technology choices
3. **Design Limitations**: Intentional scope limitations
4. **Future Limitations**: Features planned for future phases

## üéØ **Conclusion**
