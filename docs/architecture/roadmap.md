# Implementation Roadmap - Iterative Approach

## Overview

This document outlines an iterative, incremental implementation plan for the Plex Media Organizer. Instead of a rigid waterfall approach, we'll start small with movies, test in small directories, and gradually expand to TV shows and music. This approach allows for faster feedback, learning, and course correction.

**Important**: Before concluding any phase, refer to `project/development/README.md` for the complete code review checklist and lessons learned.

**Current Status**: Iteration 1 is focused on movie parsing and organization only. TV and music functionality will be added in future iterations.

## üéØ **Core Philosophy: Start Small, Iterate Fast**

### **Why Iterative?**
- **Faster Feedback**: See working results sooner
- **Easier Testing**: Test with small, manageable datasets
- **Faster Learning**: Learn from real usage and adjust approach
- **Lower Risk**: Fail fast, learn fast, improve fast
- **User Validation**: Get user feedback on core functionality early

### **Iteration Strategy**
1. **MVP First**: Get basic movie parsing working
2. **Test Small**: Use small directories for validation
3. **Expand Gradually**: Add TV shows, then music
4. **Refine Continuously**: Improve based on real-world usage

## üîß **Development Guidelines**

### **Code Quality**
- **Testing**: Write tests for each new feature
- **Refactoring**: Clean up code after each iteration
- **Documentation**: Document new APIs and features
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling from start

### **Architecture Principles**
- **Incremental**: Each iteration builds on the previous
- **Backward Compatible**: Don't break existing functionality
- **Testable**: Each component can be tested independently
- **Maintainable**: Clean interfaces and separation of concerns

### **Iteration Process**
1. **Plan**: Define scope and success criteria
2. **Implement**: Build the core functionality
3. **Test**: Validate with real data
4. **Refine**: Fix issues and improve
5. **Document**: Update docs and examples
6. **Plan Next**: Scope the next iteration

## üéØ **Key Benefits of This Approach**

### **For Development**
- **Faster Feedback**: See results in weeks, not months
- **Easier Debugging**: Smaller scope means easier problem isolation
- **Faster Learning**: Learn from real usage and adjust
- **Lower Risk**: Fail fast, learn fast, improve fast

### **For Users**
- **Early Access**: Start using basic functionality sooner
- **Incremental Value**: Each iteration adds real value
- **Better Testing**: Test with real data from the start
- **Faster Improvement**: User feedback drives development

### **For Project Success**
- **Manageable Scope**: Each iteration has clear, achievable goals
- **Continuous Progress**: Always moving forward, never stuck
- **Adaptable**: Can adjust approach based on learnings
- **Sustainable**: Maintainable development pace

---

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **Immediate Next Steps**
1. **Review Architecture**: Ensure you're comfortable with the design
2. **Set Up Environment**: Get Rust and development tools ready
3. **Plan Iteration 1**: Define exact scope and success criteria
4. **Start Small**: Begin with the most basic movie parsing

### **Success Factors**
- **Start Simple**: Don't over-engineer the first iteration
- **Test Early**: Use real data from your tree outputs
- **Iterate Fast**: Don't get stuck on perfect solutions
- **Learn Continuously**: Each iteration should teach you something

---

## üìù **Conclusion**

This iterative approach transforms a complex, long-term project into a series of manageable, achievable milestones. By starting with movies and building up, you'll:

- **See Results Faster**: Working movie parser in weeks, not months
- **Learn Continuously**: Each iteration builds on real-world experience
- **Reduce Risk**: Smaller scope means easier problem-solving
- **Build Confidence**: Each successful iteration validates the approach

The key is to resist the temptation to build everything at once. Focus on getting movies working well first, then expand to TV shows, then music. Each iteration should deliver real, usable value while building the foundation for the next.

Remember: **Perfect is the enemy of done**. Get something working, test it with real data, learn from the experience, and improve. This approach will get you to a production-ready media organizer much faster than trying to build everything at once.
