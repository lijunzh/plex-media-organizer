- **Enhanced TMDB Integration**: Fuzzy search with multiple strategies
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficient handling of large directories
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 37 unit tests + 4 integration tests
- **Safety Features**: Dry-run, backup, rollback capability
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching, async processing, progress reporting

### **Code Quality**
- **All Tests Passing**: 100% success rate
- **No Warnings**: Clean codebase
- **Good Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with anyhow

## üéØ What We Learned

### **Key Insights**
1. **Complete Code Review Essential**: Must review all code before marking iterations complete
2. **User Value Focus**: Ensure core functionality delivers expected user value
3. **Real-world Testing**: Essential for validating functionality
4. **Performance Matters**: Users appreciate fast processing
5. **Safety Features**: Critical for user confidence

### **Technical Lessons**
- **Rust Ecosystem**: Excellent for this type of application
- **Async Programming**: Powerful for I/O-bound operations
- **Error Handling**: anyhow provides excellent ergonomics
- **Testing**: Real-world data validation is invaluable
- **Documentation**: Good documentation pays dividends

### **Process Lessons**
- **Iterative Approach**: Works well for this project
- **Regular Validation**: Test against real data frequently
- **Documentation**: Keep project management docs updated
- **Code Review**: Essential for quality and completeness

### **Major Lesson Learned**

#### **Lesson 1: Complete Code Review Before Phase Conclusion**

**Date**: August 17, 2025  
**Context**: Iteration 1 completion review

**What Happened**
- **Iteration 1 was marked complete** based on parsing functionality
- **During code review**, discovered major gap: missing file organization
- **Project name**: "Plex Media Organizer" but only parsed files, didn't organize them
- **Had to create Iteration 1.5** to address the core value gap

**Root Cause**
- **Incomplete code review** before marking phase complete
- **Focus on parsing functionality** overshadowed core project goals
- **User expectations** not fully validated against implementation
- **Documentation** didn't reflect actual functionality gaps

**Impact**
- **Iteration 1 status** had to be corrected from "Complete" to "In Progress"
- **User value gap** - project doesn't deliver expected functionality
- **Development timeline** extended to address missing core features
- **Documentation** required updates to reflect actual state

**Lesson Learned**
**Never conclude an iteration without a complete code review that validates against project goals and user expectations.**

**Process Improvement**
##### **Iteration Completion Checklist**
- [ ] **Complete code review** of all source files
- [ ] **Validate against project goals** and user expectations
- [ ] **Test all functionality** end-to-end
- [ ] **Document any gaps** found during review
- [ ] **Address gaps** before marking complete
- [ ] **Update documentation** to reflect actual state

##### **Code Review Requirements**
- [ ] Review `src/main.rs` - Entry point and initialization
- [ ] Review `src/cli.rs` - User interface and commands
- [ ] Review `src/types.rs` - Data structures and types
- [ ] Review `src/config.rs` - Configuration management
- [ ] Review `src/movie_parser.rs` - Core parsing logic
- [ ] Review `src/scanner.rs` - Directory scanning
- [ ] Review `src/tmdb_client.rs` - External API integration
- [ ] Review tests - Coverage and quality
- [ ] Review documentation - Accuracy and completeness

**Prevention Strategy**
1. **Define clear phase goals** before starting development
2. **Create completion checklist** based on project requirements
3. **Perform systematic code review** against checklist
4. **Validate user expectations** against implemented functionality
5. **Document gaps** and address before marking complete

**Reference for Future Iterations**
When concluding any iteration, reference this lesson and ensure:
- Complete code review has been performed
- All project goals have been validated
- User expectations have been met
- No core functionality gaps exist

## üîß What We Could Improve

### **Process Improvements**
- **Earlier Code Review**: Conduct code reviews throughout development
- **User Feedback**: Get user feedback earlier in the process
- **Documentation**: Update documentation more frequently
- **Testing**: Add more edge case testing

### **Technical Improvements**
- **Database Integration**: Needed for persistence and caching
- **Learning System**: Could improve parsing accuracy over time
- **Performance**: Could optimize further for very large directories
- **Error Recovery**: Could improve error recovery mechanisms

## üöÄ Action Items

### **Immediate Actions**
- [ ] Complete final code review for Iteration 1
- [ ] Update project status documentation
- [ ] Prepare for Iteration 2 planning

### **Future Improvements**
- [ ] Implement database integration (Iteration 2)
- [ ] Add learning system for pattern recognition
- [ ] Enhance error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Add more comprehensive edge case testing
