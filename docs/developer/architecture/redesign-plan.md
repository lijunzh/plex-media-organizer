```

#### **Future Architecture Evolution**
- **Phase 2**: Add TVDB API alongside TMDB
- **Phase 3**: Add MusicBrainz API
- **Phase 4**: Add API abstraction layer for multiple databases

## 🎬 **English Movie First Strategy**

### **Current Focus**
- **Primary Target**: `/Volume/media/movie/English` directory structure
- **TMDB Integration**: Enhanced metadata using The Movie Database API
- **Plex Compliance**: Strict adherence to official Plex naming conventions
- **Safety First**: Dry-run mode, complete rollback functionality

### **TMDB-First Approach**
- Use TMDB as the authoritative source for movie metadata
- Intelligent fallback to filename parsing when API fails
- Fuzzy matching for handling naming variations and typos
- Comprehensive caching to minimize API calls

### **Success Metrics**
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ success rate on real-world English movie collections
- **Performance**: 100+ files/minute processing speed
- **Safety**: Zero data loss with comprehensive rollback capabilities
- **User Experience**: Intuitive CLI interface with clear feedback

## 🚀 **Future Extensibility**

### **Phase 2: TV Series Support** 🎯 **NEXT PRIORITY**
- Episode detection and season organization
- TVDB API integration
- Extend existing CLI commands for TV shows
- Mixed content handling (movies + TV shows)

**Target Timeline**: 4-6 weeks
**Success Criteria**: Handle common TV show naming patterns with 90%+ accuracy

### **Phase 3: Music Support** 📅 **FUTURE**
- Music file organization and metadata
- MusicBrainz API integration
- Artist/album/track organization

**Target Timeline**: 6-8 weeks (after TV support)
**Success Criteria**: Handle common music naming patterns with 85%+ accuracy

### **Phase 4: Multi-Language & Multi-API** 📅 **FUTURE**
- Non-English content support (anime, international films)
- Multiple external database integration
- Advanced language detection

**Target Timeline**: 8-12 weeks (after music support)
**Success Criteria**: Handle international content with 80%+ accuracy

## 🏗️ **Architecture Design Principles**
