# Implementation Roadmap - Iterative Approach

## Overview

This document outlines an iterative, incremental implementation plan for the Plex Media Organizer. Instead of a rigid waterfall approach, we'll start small with movies, test in small directories, and gradually expand to TV shows and music. This approach allows for faster feedback, learning, and course correction.

**Important**: Before concluding any phase, refer to `project/development/README.md` for the complete code review checklist and lessons learned.

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ **CLI Workflow Complete** - All 7 core commands implemented with database-backed operations, TMDB integration, and comprehensive safety features.

## üéØ **Core Philosophy: Start Small, Iterate Fast**

### **Why Iterative?**
- **Faster Feedback**: See working results sooner
- **Easier Testing**: Test with small, manageable datasets
- **Faster Learning**: Learn from real usage and adjust approach
- **Lower Risk**: Fail fast, learn fast, improve fast
- **User Validation**: Get user feedback on core functionality early

### **Iteration Strategy**
1. **MVP First**: Get basic movie parsing working
2. **Test Small**: Use small directories for validation
3. **Expand Gradually**: Add TV shows, then music
4. **Refine Continuously**: Improve based on real-world usage
