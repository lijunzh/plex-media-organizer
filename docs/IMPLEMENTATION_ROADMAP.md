# Implementation Roadmap - Iterative Approach

## Overview

This document outlines an iterative, incremental implementation plan for the Plex Media Organizer. Instead of a rigid waterfall approach, we'll start small with movies, test in small directories, and gradually expand to TV shows and music. This approach allows for faster feedback, learning, and course correction.

## 🎯 **Core Philosophy: Start Small, Iterate Fast**

### **Why Iterative?**
- **Faster Feedback**: See working results sooner
- **Easier Testing**: Test with small, manageable datasets
- **Faster Learning**: Learn from real usage and adjust approach
- **Lower Risk**: Fail fast, learn fast, improve fast
- **User Validation**: Get user feedback on core functionality early

### **Iteration Strategy**
1. **MVP First**: Get basic movie parsing working
2. **Test Small**: Use small directories for validation
3. **Expand Gradually**: Add TV shows, then music
4. **Refine Continuously**: Improve based on real-world usage

## 📝 **Conclusion**

This iterative approach transforms a complex, long-term project into a series of manageable, achievable milestones. By starting with movies and building up, you'll:

- **See Results Faster**: Working movie parser in weeks, not months
- **Learn Continuously**: Each iteration builds on real-world experience
- **Reduce Risk**: Smaller scope means easier problem-solving
- **Build Confidence**: Each successful iteration validates the approach

The key is to resist the temptation to build everything at once. Focus on getting movies working well first, then expand to TV shows, then music. Each iteration should deliver real, usable value while building the foundation for the next.

Remember: **Perfect is the enemy of done**. Get something working, test it with real data, learn from the experience, and improve. This approach will get you to a production-ready media organizer much faster than trying to build everything at once.
