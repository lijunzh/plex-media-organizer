## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

These documents serve as the **planning and design foundation** for the Plex Media Organizer project. They outline:

1. **What** we're building (Architecture)
2. **How** we'll build it (Roadmap)
3. **When** we'll build each component (Timeline)

## ðŸš€ Current Status

- **Architecture**: âœ… Complete and documented
- **Iteration 1 Implementation**: ðŸ”„ In Progress - Core features implemented, action list pending
- **Development**: ðŸ”„ Active - Completing Iteration 1 action list
- **GitHub Repository**: âœ… Live at https://github.com/lijunzh/plex-media-organizer

## ðŸ“– How to Use These Documents

### For Planning
- Review the architecture to understand the system design
- Use the roadmap to estimate development time and resources
- Identify dependencies and critical path items

### For Development
- Follow the roadmap phases sequentially
- Use the architecture as a reference during implementation
- Update documents as design decisions evolve

### For Review
- Validate the architecture against requirements
- Assess the roadmap for feasibility and completeness
- Provide feedback on design decisions and timeline

## ðŸ”„ Document Maintenance

These documents are **living documents** that should be updated as:
- Design decisions evolve during development
- New requirements are discovered
- Implementation challenges arise
- User feedback influences the design

## ðŸ“ž Questions or Feedback?

If you have questions about the architecture or roadmap, or if you'd like to provide feedback on the design, please:

1. Review the relevant document thoroughly
2. Note specific sections or decisions you'd like to discuss
3. Provide constructive feedback with alternatives if possible
